    "# Plotting graphs in Datashader with edge bundling\n",
    "\n",
    "[Datashader](http://datashader.readthedocs.org) provides general-purpose support for plotting very large collections of points, line segments, and gridded data, using a convenient API provided by [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org) and  an interactive user interface provided by [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org). While these facilities can be used to plot any sort of data, graph data (networks of nodes connected by edges) presents some special challenges.  At a minimum, the nodes and edges must be mapped into specific locations and shapes in a 2D plane before they can be visualized, which is an [open-ended problem involving a complex set of tradeoffs and complications](http://www.hiveplot.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will assume that the nodes have already been laid out in 2D, whether because they have such structure inherently (such as connections between geographic locations), or an arbitrary random or geometric layout has been selected manually, or the layout has been determined by an external tool (such as a force-directed algorithm laying out similarly connected nodes in similar locations).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll import the packages we are using and set up some defaults."
